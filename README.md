# /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\ MewMew Programming Language
### Program in Cats' Language

## Get Started
#### Integers
There's no concept of numbers (eg. 1 2 3 4 100) in MewMew, instead we use `mew`s. 1 `mew` is equal to 1 , therefor `mewmew` = 2 , `mewmewmew` = 3 , `mewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmewmew` = 10. (You got the Idea right)

#### Print
There's no keyword , to print we use the `::` symbol, for example
`::mewmew + mewmew` outputs `4`


#### Required
- ANTLR4 JAR
